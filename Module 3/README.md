## Analysis of applicationâ€™s allocation patterns

We will profile the Garbage Collector events for different application executions. We will analyse profile data based on different charts for understanding how the GC interacts with running applications.

### Code
- The code of the experiments are in the `GCExperiment.st` file. Just drag-and-drop the file into the Pharo world and select `Install into the image`.
- [VMs for GC profiling](../VMs%20for%20GC%20profiling)

### Links of interest
- Paper about GC profiling (complementary to this course): https://hal.inria.fr/hal-03332040
- We created the charts using Roassal: https://github.com/ObjectProfile/Roassal3

### Practice
- Repeat the experiment using your programs.
- Analyse the charts and compare with the produced in the video.
