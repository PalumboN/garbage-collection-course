## Analysis of applicationâ€™s allocation patterns

### Profile
We will use a profile VM for getting info of the Garbage Collector events during some programs execution. 
Then we will plot the profile data to analyse and understand how the GC interacts with our applications.

- The charts are as you have expected? Something weird?
- Can you identify some cause of GC overhead in the analysis?

### Pathological cases

- We will identify applications with pathological allocation paterns.
- We will tune the GC to achieve a better application performance.
