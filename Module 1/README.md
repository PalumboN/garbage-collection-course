## Introduction to Pharo and Object-Oriented Programming

### The game of strings
We start playing a game to understand what are the fundamental metaphore behind OOP.
For this game we need people:
- Many objects: They know each others thru _references_ (strings). They will understand (maybe not) and send messages 
- 1 object "director": Represented by the _teacher_
- 1 Garbage Collector: She/He will _instanciate_ new objects if is required, and will kill the objects when they are not neccessary anymore ðŸ’€
- The rest: Other people will control rules of the game all the time

**TODO**: Make the rules - https://docs.google.com/document/d/1j7ypqE-o1QBV3UkqNmxY__PNvyFJUVbshK2nV3L_iO8/edit



### A bit of Pharo and OOP
This lecture will provide a basic understanding of object-oriented programming (object, message, polymorphism, block closures) using Pharo. 
We will present the syntax of the language and explore the Pharo environment. 
We will use the tools (testing, inspectors, profilers) with simple programs. 


### Practice

**Download**

- Download the Pharo Launcher from: https://pharo.org/download
- Download the zip for your machine from: **TODO LINK**

**LET'S CODE!**

You can:
- Follow the Pharo MOOC from: **TODO LINK**
- Or continue with the example (adding tests, adding features, etc)
- Or create a new program / algorithm that you want
